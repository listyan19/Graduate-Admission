Simple EDA and regression analysis for Graduate Admission dataset

Just like the title, I did a simple visualization of the dataset to see the trend and which features that mostly influence the target. I also did some regression analysis using three models: linear regression, random forest, and xgboost. The dataset itself is great and suitable for studying.
